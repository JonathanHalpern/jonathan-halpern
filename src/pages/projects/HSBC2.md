Worked in a small Agile team in close contact with a Defence client. Used React and Typescript to build the user interface for a War Gaming simulation. Helped define the schema in Protobuf and used gRPC to connect with other services. Used RxJs to manipulate realtime data for a map based simulation. Optimised application to avoid unnecessary renders. Built library of reusable components following atomic design.
