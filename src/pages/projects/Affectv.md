* Worked in a small Scrum team as part of a start up with 25 employees.
* Conducted code reviews and ensured all team members were following the same best practice.

* Refactored legacy code to increase readability and reusability.
* Ran sessions with sales team to formulate new ideas for features to improve the application.
* Independently devised new tools to assist employees who were struggling to perform their tasks.
